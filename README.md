"DODGE THE ASTEROIDS"
by Abdul-Azeez Rabiu 
Guide your rocket ship through space in order to dodge the incoming asteroids and survive as long as you can.
The longer you last, the higher your score is. However, the longer you last, the harder the game also gets.
Use the '[' key to turn left, the ']' key to turn right, and the spacebar to accelerate
Press 'A' to add fixed bounding boxes to the ship and the asteroids
Press 'R' to add relative bounding boxes to the ship and the asteroids
Press 'N' to remove any bounding boxes
